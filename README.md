# Jarvis Poker

An old-school casino bar-top **video poker** machine in your browser — classic
*Jacks or Better* (9/6), hold and draw, a lit paytable, 7-segment credit/bet/win
meters, the iconic **Double-Up** gamble, and a glowing CRT cabinet.

Play it: **[poker.dabrewer.dev](https://poker.dabrewer.dev/)** · dev build at
[poker.dabrewer.dev/dev/](https://poker.dabrewer.dev/dev/)

## How to play

1. Set your wager with **BET ONE** (cycles 1→5) or **MAX BET** (5 coins, deals at once).
2. Press **DEAL** for five cards.
3. Click any cards to **HOLD** them (a gold lamp lights above each held card).
4. Press **DRAW** to replace the rest. Make a paying hand and you win.
5. On a win, **TAKE WIN** to bank it — or **DOUBLE UP** to gamble: pick a card
   higher than the dealer's to double your winnings (tie pushes, lower loses it all).
   Repeat as far as your nerve holds.
6. **CASH OUT** banks your credits.

Keyboard: `1`–`5` hold a card · `Enter`/`Space` deal / draw / take · `D` double up · `M` mute.

## Tech

- Single-file `index.html` — vanilla JS + CSS, **no framework, no build step**. Open it and it runs.
- Web Audio API for synthesized SFX (no asset files); `localStorage` for credits + stats.
- Deployed via **GitHub Pages** with a dev→prod pipeline: `main` → `/`, `dev` → `/dev/`
  (see `.github/workflows/pages.yml`).
- Registered in the Jarvis **Launcher** and **Dashboard** via the committed `.jarvis.json`.

## Develop

```bash
python3 -m http.server 3000   # then open http://localhost:3000
```

`dev` is the working branch (auto-deploys to `/dev/`); `main` is production and is
updated only via an approved PR.
